Haozhe Du obtained the Master degree in Robotics Lab at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Rong Xiong and Prof. Yue Wang. Previously, he received the B.Eng degree in Automation and also a dual degree in mechatronic engineering from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University. Haozhe is a former member of Robocup Small Size League team in Zhejiang University, with which he has won the national championship of Robocup twice in 2020 and 2021. He has been awarded with outstanding graduates of Zhejiang University, and Zhejiang Provincial Scholarship during his study at Zhejiang University.
Haozhe's current research topic is mainly about robot learning and robot manipulation. He is interested in designing generalizable algorithms for state estimation, dynamics modeling, and planning for deformable object manipulation. Previously he focus on motion prediction and decision making for robot swarm. His long-term goal is to build robust, generalizable autonomous robot agents that can achieve and surpass human performance.
